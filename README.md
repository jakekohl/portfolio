# Jake Kohl's Developer Portfolio

Hey there! 👋

This project is my personal professional portfolio — a place to highlight my work, skills, and experience in tech. But it’s more than just a digital resume. I built this site initially as a hands-on sandbox for experimenting with modern web development tools, frameworks, and best practices - but has since transitioned to being a dedicated portfolio site with a full backend service and a frontend implementation.

One of my main goals here is to showcase robust test automation, so you’ll find real-world implementations of both **Cypress** and **PlayWright** throughout the codebase. Whether you’re a recruiter, a fellow developer, or just curious, feel free to poke around and see how I approach building, testing, and continuously improving QA Test Automations within modern web applications!

## Backend

The Backend is a quick python based API Server (FastAPI) that grabs appropriate data from a configured database.

## Frontend

The Frontend is a JavaScript based project (VueJS) that also contains Cypress and Playwright Testing

## Getting Started

Refer to the individual README.md files for backend/frontend deployments. With that said - docker container deployment will be implemented soon!
