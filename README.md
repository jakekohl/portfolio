# Jake Kohl's Developer Portfolio

My personal developer portfolio site to showcase my biography, projects, and development history

## Backend

The Backend is a quick python based API Server (FastAPI) that grabs appropriate data from a configured database.

## Frontend

The Frontend is a JavaScript based project (VueJS) that also contains Cypress (and eventually Playwright) Testing

## Getting Started

Refer to the individual README.md files for backend/frontend deployments. With that said - docker container deployment will be implemented soon!
